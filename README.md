Extract all biographies to PDf files

This project arose from the need to download the biographies on the wol.jw.org site to pdf, so that they can be used by blind people.
The programs used by blind people cannot read the articles because they have images.
So I created this script to download the articles to pdf.


File bibliografia.ps1
- Extract all links from https://wol.jw.org/pt/wol/d/r5/lp-t/1200273453
- Save to a text file

File GetWebpage.ps1
- From each link in the text file, downloads the text in the webpage and save it to text file.
- Convert each to text file to pdf


NOTE: I'm a self-taught person, so the code maybe not very good and has some bugs, but does the job.
Besides, this was writen for Portuguese website.
If you need any help, you can contact me.
